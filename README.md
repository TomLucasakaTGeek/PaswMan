# PASSOP


## Problem Statement: 
We use various websites daily, some we scroll on for hours and hours and some just slip from our mind after creating an account. What if there was an app that stored your username and password for that particular website. PS: Microsoft ü™ü already does that, but here the data stays with you and you only on your browser's localstorage. And we should welcome a much cleaner UI design.


## Techstack:
- **React.js:** A frontend development library by Facebook, that allows us to manage data as states and design a component-based architecture.
- **TailwindCSS:** A minimalistic CSS framework that allows for blazingly fast development of frontend components of our application.
- **Node.js:** A runtime envviroment for executing Javascript on server-side. Allows for development of server methods using only Javascript.
- **Express.js:** A minimalistic backend web framework to work with Node.js and create server using Javascript and pre-built method definitions.
- **MongoDB:** A no-SQL database that carries data in JSON format, allowing for flexibility and ease of data storage and transfer.
